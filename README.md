# YouthQuake-clone
The following static website is purely made using HTML and CSS. 
I tried to make it in a week because I was assigned to make a clone of this website [https://www.youthquake.it/en/works/sostravel] for my front-end assessment  using some of the things that I knew about HTML and CSS.
